    <p class="text_column">Every single year, it is estimated that more than 300 million people suffer from depression, with Kenya ranking 6<sup>th</sup> in Africa with 1.9 million people in 2017. </p>
    <p class="text_column">Unfortunately, medical care for those affected is not only expensive, but not easily accessible. Also, it tends to affect the youth mostly, who are just finding their feet economically. Add to that fact the stigma associated with mental health issues and most people feel like it's hopeless, leading them to measures like comitting suicide. </p>
    <p class="text_column">Thus when we created the bot (that we hope you enjoy using) we had a few simple missions:</br>
	To give someone suffering hope that they can get better</br>
		To lessen the stigma around mental health by starting conversations about it</br>
		To enable people get access to the many institutions that will give them the care they deserve</br>
		To reassure them that they are worthy
